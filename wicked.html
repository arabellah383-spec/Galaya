             Wicked is a musical fantasy adventure that tells the untold story of the witches of Oz, focusing on Elphaba, the misunderstood “Wicked Witch of the West,” and Glinda, the bubbly “Good Witch of the North.” The film explores their unlikely friendship, contrasting personalities, and the events that lead Elphaba down a path misunderstood by the world. Filled with dazzling musical numbers, magical landscapes, and political intrigue, Wicked reimagines the classic story from The Wizard of Oz, highlighting themes of friendship, identity, and the consequences of judgment and prejudice.

            Wicked successfully brings the beloved Broadway musical to the big screen, combining spectacular visuals, memorable musical numbers, and strong performances from its leads. Cynthia Erivo delivers a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Elphaba, while Ariana Grande shines as the charismatic and charming Glinda. The film captures the magic, humor, and heart of the stage production, exploring themes of friendship, identity, and the consequences of prejudice. Though some critics note that a few musical sequences feel slightly condensed for the cinematic format, the overall production is visually stunning and emotionally engaging. Wicked is a must-watch for fans of musicals and fantasy, offering a fresh perspective on the story of Oz.
