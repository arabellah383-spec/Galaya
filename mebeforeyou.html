            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>
           Me Before You is a romantic drama that delivers both heartfelt emotion and bittersweet storytelling. Emilia Clarke brings charm and warmth to Louisa Clark, while Sam Claflin portrays Will Traynor with a mix of wit, depth, and vulnerability. The film effectively explores complex themes such as love, personal choice, and coping with life-altering circumstances, though some critics noted it leans heavily on melodrama. Its strengths lie in the chemistry between the leads, the emotional resonance of the story, and the balance of humor with poignant moments. Overall, it is a touching, if occasionally predictable, love story that resonates with audiences seeking both romance and emotional depth.
